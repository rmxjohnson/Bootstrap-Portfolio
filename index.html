                            Ohio. In testing the software at my workplace, I became interested in learning how to develop
                            the code that I test on a daily basis. I first began my college career at Case Western Reserve
                            University and am now excited to be completing the Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp through
                            CWRU.

                        <p>
                            For recreation, I enjoy a variety of activities. In warm weather, I prefer being outdoors. I enjoy hiking, kayaking, biking,
                            and jogging. Last spring, I finished my 1st half-marathon. Not a stellar finish-time, but was
                            satisfied to complete the race. I like working in my flowers outside but do not have much of
                            a green thumb. I love traveling and hope to plan a trip overseas in the near future. I also like
                            reading and belong to a bookclub with coworkers. Over the past winter, I have completed several
                            projects around the house, becoming quite proficient at painting. I like the sense of accomplishment
                            I feel when they have been completed.
